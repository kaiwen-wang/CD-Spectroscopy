### How was this made?
The data visualization uses Chart.js to create the CD and voltage graphs. The button logic is just raw Javascript while the CSS formatting comes from [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground/blob/master/LICENSE) open source project. Material Design Lite is used for the button styling.

As per the original license, this project is also licensed under the Apache License. Feel free to use any of the chart data or visualization logic for derivative works.

### Credits
This site was built by Kaiwen Wang part time over the Spring 2022 semester as part of a collaboration with Georgia Tech's Center for Teaching and Learning.

A big thanks goes to Dr. Mary Peek and Dr. Dexter Dean of Georgia Tech's School of Chemistry and Biochemsitry for their help in explaining the theory behind this technique and collecting the data used for this visualization and Dr. Vincent Spezzo as the department manager for CTL.
